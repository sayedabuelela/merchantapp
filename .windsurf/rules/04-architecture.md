# Clean Architecture Guidelines

- Keep files focused on a single responsibility.
- Extract UI elements into reusable components when appropriate.
- Extract business logic into custom hooks.
- Never put data fetching, state management, and UI in the same file.
- Prefer separation: components / hooks / services / utils / types.
- Avoid over-engineering; keep solutions simple and maintainable.
