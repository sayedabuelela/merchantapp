- Prefer functional components with hooks.
- Keep components small, readable, and simple.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders unless optimization is required.
- Use FlatList/SectionList instead of mapping in ScrollViews.
- Use Expo APIs and React Native community libraries when possible.
- Follow platform conventions (iOS/Android differences only when needed).
- Never modify working logic unless the user explicitly asks for it.
